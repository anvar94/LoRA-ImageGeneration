LoRA-ImageGeneration
This repository demonstrates how to fine-tune Stable Diffusion models using DreamBooth with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient image generation. The goal is to train custom models capable of generating high-quality, subject-specific images with minimal computational resources.

Features
Fine-tune large-scale Stable Diffusion models with LoRA for efficient training.
Use DreamBooth to adapt models for generating specific subjects or styles.
Lightweight and scalable solutions for personalized image generation.
Automatic integration with the Hugging Face Hub.
Model Training
This project uses the DreamBooth LoRA training script provided by Hugging Face's diffusers library.

Training Command
The following command fine-tunes the stable-diffusion-v1-5 model using the DreamBooth LoRA training script:

bash
Copy code
accelerate launch diffusers/examples/dreambooth/train_dreambooth_lora.py \
  --pretrained_model_name_or_path=stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5 \
  --instance_data_dir=/fogi/ \
  --output_dir=/output/ \
  --instance_prompt="a photo of fogi bear" \
  --resolution=512 \
  --train_batch_size=1 \
  --gradient_accumulation_steps=4 \
  --learning_rate=1e-4 \
  --lr_scheduler=constant \
  --lr_warmup_steps=0 \
  --max_train_steps=500 \
  --validation_prompt="A photo of fogi bear is sitting in a table" \
  --validation_epochs=50 \
  --seed=0 \
  --push_to_hub
Explanation of Key Parameters:
--pretrained_model_name_or_path: Specifies the base Stable Diffusion model.
--instance_data_dir: Directory containing training images (e.g., photos of the subject).
--output_dir: Path where the fine-tuned model and LoRA weights will be saved.
--instance_prompt: Text prompt used during training to describe the subject.
--resolution: Resolution of the training images.
--train_batch_size: Batch size for training.
--gradient_accumulation_steps: Number of steps to accumulate gradients before updating weights.
--learning_rate: Learning rate for training.
--lr_scheduler: Scheduler for adjusting the learning rate.
--max_train_steps: Maximum number of training steps.
--validation_prompt: Text prompt used for validation during training.
--validation_epochs: Number of epochs between validation runs.
--push_to_hub: Pushes the fine-tuned model to the Hugging Face Hub.
Inference
After fine-tuning, the LoRA weights can be loaded into a Stable Diffusion pipeline for inference.

Example Code:
python
Copy code
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the fine-tuned model
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-v1-5", torch_dtype=torch.float16
)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

# Load LoRA weights
pipe.load_lora_weights("Anvar94/output3")

# Generate an image
prompt = "A picture of fogi bear sitting on a beach at sunset"
image = pipe(prompt, num_inference_steps=25).images[0]

# Display the generated image
plt.imshow(image)
plt.axis("off")
plt.title(f"Prompt: {prompt}")
plt.show()
Dataset
The dataset used for training consists of images of a unique subject (e.g., "fogi bear"). These images should:

Be diverse (different angles, lighting, etc.).
Match the resolution specified during training (e.g., 512x512).
Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher
Libraries:
transformers
diffusers
accelerate
torch
matplotlib
Install dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Results
The trained model can generate images of the subject in various settings or styles based on prompts. Examples include:

Prompt: "A photo of fogi bear sitting on a table"
Prompt: "A picture of fogi bear on a beach at sunset"
